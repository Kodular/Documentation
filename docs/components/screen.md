# Screen

**Screen** is the top-most component in any app. All the other components are placed on a **Screen**.

If you take the app as a book, the Screens can be regarded as the pages of a book and the other components
as the various elements present on a page of a book, text, images etc.

!!! quote "[App ID - Android Developer docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id)"
    Every Android app has a unique application ID that looks like a Java package name, such as `com.example.myapp`. This ID uniquely identifies your app on the device and in Google Play Store. If you want to upload a new version of your app, the application ID  must be the same as the original APK—if you change the application ID, Google Play Store treats   the APK as a completely different app. So once you publish your app, you should never change the application ID.


### Primary Color

`Type: Color`_

The Primary color that will be used throughout the app.

_**\(** Designer Only **\)**
