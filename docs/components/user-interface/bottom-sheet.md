# Bottom Sheet

## Overview
The **Bottom Sheet** component is used to display a modal-like dialog with the contents that can be 
populated from a [Layout](/components/layout) or can be set to show just a single Component.

These modal-like **Bottom Sheet**s  are usually used as an alternative to menu or as a simple dialog.

### Show Dialog

_**\(** None **\)**_

Display the **Bottom Sheet** on the Screen.

!!! caution "Note"
    Before this Method is used, the contents of the **Bottom Sheet** must be set using either [Register Component As Dialog](#register-component-as-dialog) or [Register Layout As Dialog](#register-layout-as-dialog)

## Events

### Closed

_**\(** None **\)**_

Indicates that the **Bottom Sheet** has been dismissed and closed.


### Opened

_**\(** None **\)**_

## Note

 * The Component or Layout used in [Register Component As Dialog](#register-component-as-dialog) or [Register Layout As Dialog](#register-layout-as-dialog) should be visible on the screen(i.e the Visible property of the Component or the Layout used should be `true`) at the time when either of those methods are used. It will be hidden from the Screen automatically after the BottomSheet is set to show that Component or Layout. 

* The Component or Layout used should have its __Height__ property set to `Automatic`.
  It may not work as expected for other options.


## Example

The below blocks can be used for the showing a _Vertical Arrangement_ in **Bottom Sheet**.
Please note that any of the arrangements,not only the _Vertical Arrangement_ can be used in a  
**Bottom Sheet** .
