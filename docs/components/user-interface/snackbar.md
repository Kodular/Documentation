# Snackbar

## Overview
Snackbars are used in to provide feedback about an operation performed in the app.  
They show a message at the bottom of the screen and lower left part of the screen on larger screens.  

Snackbars are shown above all the other visible components on the screen.
Only one **Snackbar** can be visible at any given time.

There are two components in a **Snackbar**:

1. `Message` - The text that is shown on the **Snackbar**.
2. `Action Button` - An optional button that can be shown on the right end of the **Snackbar**.  
A click on this button can be detected with the [Click](#click) event.
