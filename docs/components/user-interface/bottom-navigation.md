# Bottom Navigation

Bottom Navigation menu is used as a way to provide movement through the primary destinations of your app.
It is used to navigate between the top-level sections of an app.

For example, if your app is for displaying the various files in the storage, you can have a **Bottom Navigation** menu for
the showing various files in one section, only the audio files in one section, only the video files in one section, only the documents 
in one section. Now this is a right usage of **Bottom Navigation** menu, since these are the main sections of this particular app and
they facilitate navigation thorough them. 

It is recommended that this be used only to provide the navigation to the main sections of your app
to make the app better in terms of user experience.

There can be a maximum of 5 menu items in the **Bottom Navigation** menu, at any given time.

!!! tip
    Although Kodular is flexible enough to allow you to add a **Bottom Navigation** menu anywhere in the layout of the app
    we recommend that it always be placed at the bottom (since it is _Bottom_ Navigation :wink:)
