# Linear Progressbar

## Overview
A Progressbar is used to visually indicate the user the progress of some task, such as a download, data transfer etc.

A **determinate progress bar** is used to indicate the progress of an task whose exact value of  progress is known for eg. the percentage of a file download, number of files transferred.

A **indeterminate progress bar** is used in situations where the extent of the task is unknown  or the progress of the task cannot be determined in a way that could be expressed as a percentage, for example, when a request to a server is being processed where we don't know the exact value of progress, but there is a need to indicate to the user that the task is in progress.

A determinate progressbar fills from 0% to 100%.  
An indeterminate progress bar moves in a fixed path, growing and shrinking in size.
