# Staging updates with Firebase Remote Config

## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to update your app in stages using the Firebase Remote Config component. With staged updates, you can control which users see the update based on their country, age, etc., or choose to show updates only to a percentage of your users chosen at random.

Staged updates are useful when introducing new features, especially for projects without a dedicated beta testing program. You will be able to gather useful feedback from your random testing group before your release is made available to all. Moreover, you will be able to roll back any "failed" updates without causing major issues.

### Why Firebase Remote Config?

Firebase Remote Config lets you enable and disable features to specific users without having them update the app. These features can be both minor (like a new social login provider) and major (like a total redesign of your app). Remote Config is very similar to the OTA update system Android device manufacturers use to update your Android version.

You will be making a simple app with a tab layout. Using the Firebase Remote Config component, you will then show a bottom navigation instead of the tab layout to 20% of your users. You will also learn how to release the update to all users, and also to roll-back the changes.

## Pre-requisites
Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide.

 * Working with Firebase
 * Working with the Tab Layout and Bottom Navigation components

!!! caution
		This is guide covers advanced topics like Firebase, staged rollouts, and generic blocks. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here.

## First steps

Head over to [your Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com){:target="_blank"} to set up Remote Config for your Firebase project. If you do not have an existing project, create a new one.

Use the navigation menu on the left to go to the Remote Config section.

Firebase Remote Config works using `parameters` and `values`. Your will app will fetch the `value` of a `parameter` and then decide how to proceed. Firebase can send different `value`s to different users, based on some conditions you can set. In this guide, we will create a `parameter` called `bottom_nav_enabled`, which returns `false` for all users except the 20% chosen at random.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/ext_frc-param-name.png)

Give the parameter a name
{: .img-caption}

Next, add a condition to your `parameter`. Every conditon has a name, so that it can be identified easily when several are being used. We will name our condition `random_testers_group`. There are several constraints to choose from, but for this guide, we will restrict ourselves to "User in random percentile".

Add a condition
{: .img-caption}

!!! tip
		It is possible to chain several constraints in a single condition using the "and" button.

Your `parameter` can now have two `value`s: one for those in the `random_testers_group`, and another for everybody else. Set the `value` to "true" for the testers, and "false" for others.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/ext_frc-param-value.png)

Add values to your parameter

Finally, click on "Add parameter", and then click "Publish changes".

Publish your changes
{: .img-caption}

!!! warning
		Publishing your changes will make them live to all your users. Make sure you check everything twice before publishing!

That's it for the Firebase part. Now let's move to building your app.

## Designing the app

As usual, we'll start with a new project. Drag and drop the `Tab Layout`, `Bottom Navigation`, and `Firebase Remote Config` components. Also add three `Vertical Arrangement` components to the `Screen`. They will function as the different "sub-views" of the app which can be accessed using the `Tab Layout` or `Bottom Navigation`.

Give each `Vertical Arrangement` a distinct background color, and set their heights and widths to `Fill Parent`. Ensure only one arrangement is visible at a time, so set the `Visible` property of two arrangements to `False`.

Finally, set the `Visible` property of the `Bottom Navigation` component to `False`. By default, users will navigate your app using the tab layout. We change this behavior for the random testers group from the Blocks Editor.

!!! warning
		You will have to upload the `google-services.json` file to Assets to be able to export your app. This file can be obtained from your Firebase Console.

This is what your designer should look like

## Coding the blocks

We first create all the tabs when the screen initializes. In this guide, we have three tabs: Home, Products, and Cart.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/e_screen-initialize.png)

Next, we handle "selections" on the tabs using a procedure which takes the `id` of the tab as an input. We loop through all the vertical arrangements and set their `Visible` property to `False`. Then, we get the selected tab item and its corresponding arrangement, and set its `Visible` property to `True`. Generic blocks make it easier to manipulate the visibility of the components, especially in apps with several tabs.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/p_select-arrangement.png)

We call this procedure from the `Tab Layout` component's `Tab Item Selected` event.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/e_tab-item-selected.png)

We do the same for the `Bottom Navigation` component: first add the menu items (in the Screen's `Initialize` event), and then handle the selection event.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/m_add-item.png)

!!! info
		The icon assets for the navigation items are provided in the AIA in the [Downloads](#downloads) section.

We can use the same prodcedure we made for the `Tab Layout`.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/e_item-selected.png)

Now for the important bit. We use the `Firebase Remote Config` component to get the visibility status of the `Bottom Navigation` component. Before we use any of the parameters, we need to fetch all data from Firebase.
Place the `fetch` block in the Screen's `Initialize` event to do so.

![](/assets/images/guides/remote-config/m_fetch.png)

Once the data has been fetched, we get the value of the `bottom_navigation_enabled` parameter. Since this is a boolean parameter, we use the `Get Boolean` block to retrieve the value.

This value can be either `True` or `False`, depending on the status of the user. If the user is in the randomly chosen 20% (our `random_testers_group`), then `True` is returned, `False` otherwise.

If the value is `True`, we show the `Bottom Navigation` instead of the `Tab Layout`.

!!! note
		Updates to parameters can take a few hours to update across all devices, so don't be alarmed if you don't see all changes immediately.

### Releasing the update to everyone
To release the changes to all your users, simply go to your Firebase Console and remove the condition from the `parameter` so that it always returns true.

### Rolling back updates
To roll back the update you've made, remove the condition from the `parameter` and set the default value to false. This ensures nobody sees the `Bottom Navigation` anymore.

Congratulations! You've successfully learnt to stage your app updates and release features to select users!

Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide.

 - How to set up Remote Config in Firebase.
 - How to show features only to a few users.
 - How to create a simple screen with a Tab Layout and a Bottom Navigation.
 - How to fetch the Remote Config parameters.
 - How to use the fetched data to change the layout of your app during runtime.

## Next steps

Want ideas for making this app better? We have some things for you to try.

 - Add more constraints to your condition. For example, show the `Bottom Navigation` to 20% of your users from the USA.
 - Create more parameters and values.
 - Add language based constraints. For instance, show a link to a German-English dictionary in your app if the user is from Germany.
 - Roll back features and release them to all your users.
 - Add a feedback form to your app so that users can share their thoughts on the `Bottom Navigation`. Ensure that the feedback form is shown only to users who see the `Bottom Navigation`!
