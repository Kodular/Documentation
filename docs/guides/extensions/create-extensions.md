# Creating Extensions

!!! info
    **Now you can just skip this tutorial and paste your code in** [**Kodular IDE**](https://ide.kodular.io)**!**

## Tools you will need

!!! warning
    This guide assumes you to be a **Windows** user.

* [x] [App Inventor Sources ](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources)
* [x] [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [x] [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)
* [x] [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) \(or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)\)
* [x] Java IDE/Text Editor \([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org), [Atom](https://atom.io/) are recommended\)

## Step 1: Setting up Java JDK

* Install JDK

!!! warning
    _Be sure not to install it in a directory whose path contains spaces_

* Set the Environmental Variables:  
    * Set `JAVA_HOME` to where you installed Java JDK.

    For example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131`

    * Edit `PATH` and add those:

    `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`, `%JAVA_HOME%/jre/bin`, `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath`
    
* **Check Java installation:**

    ```bash  
    $ java -version  
    java version "1.8.0_131"  
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)  
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)  
    ```

## Step 2: Setting up Apache Ant

* Unzip the folder and move it to a place where it is safe. For example: `C:\apache-ant-1.10.1`

!!! warning
    _Be sure not to install it in a directory whose path contains spaces_

* Set the Environmental Variables:
    * **Set** `ANT_HOME` to where you have the Ant folder placed. For example: `C:\Ant\apache-ant-1.10.1`
    * **Edit** `Path` and add `%ANT_HOME%\bin`
    * **Edit** `ClassPath` and add `%ANT_HOME%\bin`
* **Check Ant installation**:

    ```bash  
    $ ant -version  
    Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.1 compiled on February 2 2017
    ```

## Step 3: Setting up Git

* Set it up as written in this [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
* **Check Git installation**:

    ```bash  
    $ git version  
    git version 2.11.0.windows.3
    ```

## Step 4: App Inventor Sources

* Unzip the folder and move it to a place where it is safe

!!! warning
    _Be sure not to place it in a directory whose path contains spaces_

## Step 5: Building an Extension

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pavi2410/c58954d86e8510e7300b1253c5ecca4a.js"></script>

* Save the above code to `appinventor-sources/appinventor/components/src/io/kodular/`as `SimpleMaths.java`
* Go back to the `appinventor` folder.
* Open Command Prompt on that directory.
* Type `ant extensions` and click on enter.

### _Wait for the extension to build..._

!!! success
    If it says: **`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`**, then you just created an extension. :-\)

!!! danger
    But if it says: `BUILD FAILED`, then you did something wrong and have to look over again. :-\(

## Step 6: Sharing Extensions

Your extension file \(.aix file\) should appear in the directory:

`appinventor-sources/appinventor/components/build/extensions`

Now, you can easily share the aix files with anyone and can import it into Kodular seemlessly.

* For more information about extensions, read [here](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/other/extensions.html)

* Keep making more and more and more extensions and help our community to build the best app.

* [Share your extensions](https://community.kodular.io/c/extensions) with our community and become an "[Extension Developer](https://community.kodular.io/badges/102/extension-developer)".
