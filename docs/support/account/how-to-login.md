At Kodular, we prioritize user security. Due to this, we have developed a new robust authentication system. You will be
automatically redirected every single time to **Kodular Auth** if you wish to access to any service.

For example, if wanting to go to Kodular Creator, this workflow will occur:

1. Go to [creator.kodular.io](https://creator.kodular.io).
2. When page finishes loading, you will be redirected to Kodular Auth.
3. Optional. Register for an account if you don't have any, or use a social provider.
4. Authenticate using your Kodular Account credentials.
5. Optional. If your account is protected with 2FA, input the 6-digit code generated in your app.
5. Optional. If this is your first time using a service, you will have to Authorize this service.
7. You are redirected back to [creator.kodular.io](https://creator.kodular.io).

And you are in! Remember you can manage your Kodular Account from [My Kodular](https://my.kodular.io).
