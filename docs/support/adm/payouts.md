# How do I request a payout?

Payouts can be requested from [My Kodular](https://my.kodular.io/payments). We handle all payouts and distribute all
revenue.

## Funding your balance

As soon as we receive the money from Google, we will update your balance and make it available for withdrawal. This
usually happens between **20th and 25th of the next month**.

Once your balance has been updated, you can go ahead and request a payout.

## Requesting a payout

Go to your [Balance](https://my.kodular.io/payments/balance). If you have enough balance, you will be able to withdraw a
custom amount.

This payout will be scheduled to be sent in the upcoming batch. If you are unable to request one, maybe checking
[this FAQ](payouts-requirements.md) can solve your issue.

## Processing payouts batches

Every Monday, we process all requested payouts in different batches. Once it has been processed, it will arrive to your
bank account within the next 2 business days (or instant if using PayPal as payout method).
