# What is Google Ad Manager?

**Google Ad Manager is an ad exchange platform** owned by Google. It both allows publishers and advertisers to monetize
content using Google Ads (or custom ones). **Kodular has partnered with Google**, so **we can provide access to Google
Ads inventory** through this platform.

## Google Ad Manager vs. Google Admob

Google Admob is Google's solution to easily monetize mobile apps using Google Ads inventory. Despite being the most used
one, it does not provide features that would allow us to provide an integration of the quality we would like.

Additionally, Admob would require lots of setup steps before getting ready to use it. In contrast, **we can provide a
seamless integration that just requires signing up with our account**. No Ad Units are needed, making all the
integration way smoother.

## Revenue shares and fill rates

Our Google Ad Manager will be using Google Ads inventory, providing the highest quality ads. Thanks to this, you can
certainly **expect higher revenue shares and fill rates**.
