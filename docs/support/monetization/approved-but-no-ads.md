# My app has been approved, but still the ads are not showing

There can be multiple reasons for the ads not showing.

Generally, it is helpful to use the `Error Occurred` event(s) of the components
and examine the error message to find the exact cause of Ads not working.

The error messages are usually self-explanatory, but if you want any help, feel free to open a
