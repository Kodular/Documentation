# Pricing

!!! success "How much does it cost?"
    Kodular is **FREE**!

Kodular Creator is **completely free of charge**. You can use it for whatever you want, and _we will never ask you to pay us_.

We wanted it like that so **anyone could convert their desired ideas into apps** in a simple way. We think that _everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing how to code_. That is why our platform is free and **it will remain like that forever**.

This also extends to **Kodular Store** and **Kodular Extensions IDE**.

## Commissions

!!! tip "Updated: 19 January 2019 - 02 May 2019"
    Due to some technical issues with Google, apps generated with Kodular Creator Versions from Draco 1.3.1 to 1.3B.4, both included, will be free of comission. We will update this page as soon as it gets fixed.

However, to keep our services for free, _we take a small comission from your earnings in ads_. We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings.

The components we take commissions from are **only** AdMob ones (_AdMob Banner_, _AdMob Interstitial_ and _AdMob Rewarded Video_). The other ones are free of commissions.

The percentage of your earnings we take **varies from a basic 5% up to a 20%**, depending on the _number of features_ you use in your app. For example, if an app with AdMob Ads is very simple, _we will only take the 5% of those earnings_. But if the app uses all our components and features, _the commission will be of 20%_.

You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. **We take it automatically** from your AdMob & AdSense earnings, reducing your work.

## Premium Plan

Since _time ago_, we have said that [**Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan**](https://community.kodular.io/t/premium-plan-nope/709). This also extends to **Kodular Store**.

But the **Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan**. Currently available features _will not disappear or will not reduce its features_. We will only **develop new features** for the Premium Plan, for example _removing the waiting queue_ or _uploading custom libraries_.
