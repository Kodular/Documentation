# Pricing

!!! success "How much does it cost?"
    Kodular is **FREE**!

Kodular Creator is **completely free of charge**. You can use it for whatever you want, and _we will never ask you to pay us_.

We wanted it to be like that so **anyone could convert their awesome ideas into apps** in a simple way. We believe that _everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing how to code_. That's why, our platform is free and **it will remain like that forever**.

This also extends to **Kodular Store** and **Kodular Extensions IDE**.

!!! quote "Why this business model?"
    Kodular was created to provide an accessible suite for everyone to learn and, later, professionally create apps. Due to this, we strongly believe learning to code has to be a right and nobody should have to pay in order to learn the basics of programming.  
    Kodular Creator provides one of the most complete tools in Internet to create apps without coding, and moreover it is being used by tons of developers from all over the world. Everybody should be able to make their ideas a reality, independently of their income. Someone can have the next big revolutionary idea, but sometimes without money it cannot be done.  
    We don’t want this to happen.  
    **What is fairer? Getting a fixed quota from everyone, without taking into account if they earn something, or taking the proportional earnings people make with our platform?** We think the answer is very obvious.  
    We **DO NOT** earn a single penny from the apps that don’t earn anything with our platform. We only earn from the apps that are monetized with ads or IAP.

## Commissions

!!! tip "Updated: 19 January 2019 - 02 May 2019"
    Due to some technical issues with Google, apps generated with Kodular Creator Versions from Draco 1.3.1 to 1.3B.4, both included, will be free of comission. We will update this page as soon as it gets fixed.

To keep our services free for everyone, forever, _we take a small percentage of commission from your earnings in ads_. We do not force anybody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings.

The ads from which we take commissions are **only** Interstitial ones. All other ad types are free of commissions

The percentage of commission we take from your earnings **starts from a basic 5%**, and increases depending on the _number of components and features_ you use in your app. For example, if an app is very simple, _we will only take the 5% of those earnings_. But if the app uses all our components and features, _the commission will be increased_.  
You can calculate the final commission using [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kodular.commission).

!!! tip "Ceiling Values"
    Although, the commission depends on the amount of components and features you use in your app and increases as you add more of them, the celing values ensures that it (commission) don't cross a certain amount. This way, the **commission won't get higher** once you hit the ceiling values.

You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. **We take it automatically** using something called "fallback ads". Find more information about this [here](https://community.kodular.io/t/new-commissions-system/27418/).

## Premium Plan

Since _time ago_, we have said that [**Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan**](https://community.kodular.io/t/premium-plan-nope/709). This also extends to **Kodular Store**.

But the **Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan**. Currently available features _will not disappear or will not reduce its features_. We will only **develop new features** for the Premium Plan, for example _removing the waiting queue_ or _uploading custom libraries_.
