# Pricing

!!! success "How much does it cost?"
    Kodular is **FREE**!

Kodular Creator is **completely free of charge**. You can use it for whatever you want, and _we will never ask you to pay us_.

We wanted it like that so **anyone could convert their desired ideas into apps** in a simple way. We think that _everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing how to code_. That is why our platform is free and **it will remain like that forever**.

This also extends to **Kodular Store** and **Kodular Extensions IDE**.

??? note "Why this business model?"
    Kodular was created to providen accessible suite for everyone to learn and, later, professionally create apps
    Due to this, we strongly believe learning to code has to be a right and nobody should have to pay in order to learn the basics of programming.  
    Kodular Creator provides one of the most complete tools in Internet to create apps without coding, and moreover it is being used by tons of students all over the world.

    Everybody has to be able to make their idea reality independently of their income.  
    Someone can have the next big revolutionary idea, but sometimes without money it cannot be done.  
    We don’t want this to happen.

    Also, as you might know, we take a small commission from Interstitial components.  
    What is fairer? Getting a fixed quota from everyone, without taking into account if they earn something, or taking the proportional earnings people make with our platform?  
    I think the answer is very obvious.

    We do not earn nothing from people which doesn’t earn anything with our platform.  
    And we only earn from people who monetize their apps, earning money with Kodular Creator.

## Commissions

!!! tip "Updated: 19 January 2019 - 02 May 2019"
    Due to some technical issues with Google, apps generated with Kodular Creator Versions from Draco 1.3.1 to 1.3B.4, both included, will be free of comission. We will update this page as soon as it gets fixed.

However, to keep our services for free, _we take a small comission from your earnings in ads_. We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings.

The components we take commissions from are **only** Interstitial ones. The other ones are free of commissions. Interstitial ads are the top performing ad types.

The percentage of your earnings we take **varies from a basic 10% up to a 20%**, depending on the _number of features_ you use in your app. For example, if an app with Interstitial Ads is very simple, _we will only take the 10% of those earnings_. But if the app uses all our components and features, _the commission will be of 20%_.

You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. **We take it automatically** using something called "fallback ads". Find more information about this [here](https://community.kodular.io/t/new-commissions-system/27418/).

## Premium Plan

Since _time ago_, we have said that [**Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan**](https://community.kodular.io/t/premium-plan-nope/709). This also extends to **Kodular Store**.

But the **Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan**. Currently available features _will not disappear or will not reduce its features_. We will only **develop new features** for the Premium Plan, for example _removing the waiting queue_ or _uploading custom libraries_.
