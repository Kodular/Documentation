The Component 's behaviour is configured using Blocks Components + Blocks = Your Awesome App ! What are Components ? Components are the basic building elements of any app in Kodular. Everything in the app is done with the help of one component or the other. Different components are used for different purposes. One component may be used to design the User Interface(UI) of the app, for example a Button component, while others may be used for performing actions like communicating to a database, saving an image to the Android device's folder etc. for example the FirebaseDB component. What are Blocks ? Blocks are ones which are used describe how to do a task. The way in which the Components respond to various actions and events in the app is designed using the Blocks . For example, how the app should respond when a Button is clicked, what data is to be communicated to the database using FirebaseDB component etc. are all configured using the Blocks . Thus, by using the various Components and by configuring its behaviour and response to actions from the user with the help of Blocks , an app is \"koded\" in Kodular. The Car Analogy Let us consider an analogy of a Car to better understand the concept of the components and blocks. A Car is constructed using various parts, like wheels, doors, engine, steering etc. each performing its own unique function. Some of these parts are visible to the driver(who is the user of the car) and he interacts with them directly, while some of them are not visible. And these parts know what their function is and how to perform it, for example, the function of the wheel is to provide support and move the car, the function of the steering wheel is to help streer the car and so on. An Android app is like the Car. Like how a car has various parts, an app is constructed using various Components , like Button, Label, File etc. with each component being used for a particular purpose. Like the parts of the Car, some of these Components are visible to the user of the app and they interact with it, while some of the components don't interact directly with the user.

If_thing_is a list, returns true; otherwise, returns false. list to csv row Interprets the list as a row of a table and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the row. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. Items are separated by commas. For example, converting the list (a b c d) to a CSV row produces (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"). The returned row text does not have a line separator at the end. list from csv row Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted row to produce a list of fields. For example, converting (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") to a list produces (a b c d). list to csv table Interprets the list as a table in row-major format and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the table. Each item in the list should itself be a list representing a row of the CSV table. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. In the returned text, items in rows are separated by commas and rows are separated by CRLF (\\r\\n). list from csv table Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted table to produce a list of rows, each of which is a list of fields. Rows can be separated by newlines (\\n) or CRLF (\\r\\n). lookup in pairs Used for looking up information in a dictionary-like structure represented as a list.

It is a mutator block and can be expanded to allow more numbers in the product. / Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. ^ Returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second. random integer Returns a random integer value between the given values, inclusive. The order of the arguments doesn't matter. random fraction Returns a random value between 0 and 1. random set seed to Use this block to generate repeatable sequences of random numbers. You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values. min Returns the smallest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, min will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown. max Returns the largest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, max will also consider 0 in its set of numbers. This block is a mutator and a dropdown. square root Returns the square root of the given number. absolute Returns the absolute value of the given number. neg Returns the negative of a given number. log Returns the natural logarithm of a given number, that is, the logarithm to the base e (2.71828...). e^ Returns e (2.71828...) raised to the power of the given number. round Returns the given number rounded to the closest integer. If the fractional part is .5 it will be rounded down. It it is .5 it will be rounded up. If it is exactly equal to .5, numbers with an even whole part will be rounded down, and numbers with an odd whole part will be rounded up. (This method is called round to even .) ceiling Returns the smallest integer that's greater than or equal to the given number. floor Returns the greatest integer that's less than or equal to the given number. modulo Modulo(a,b) is the same as remainder(a,b) when a and b are positive. More generally, modulo(a,b) is defined for any a and b so that (floor(a/b)\u00d7 b) + modulo(a,b) = a. For example, modulo(11, 5) = 1, modulo(-11, 5) = 4, modulo(11, -5) = -4, modulo(-11, -5) = -1. Modulo(a,b) always has the same sign as b, while remainder(a,b) always has the same sign as a. remainder Remainder(a,b) returns the result of dividing a by b and taking the remainder. The remainder is the fractional part of the result multiplied by b. For example, remainder(11,5) = 1 because In this case, is the fractional part. We multiply this by b, in this case 5 and we get 1, our remainder. Other examples are remainder(-11, 5) = -1, remainder(11, -5) = 1, and remainder(-11, -5) = -1. quotient Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second and discarding any fractional part of the result. sin Returns the sine of the given number in degrees. cos Returns the cosine of the given number in degrees. tan Returns the tangent of the given number in degrees. asin Returns the arcsine of the given number in degrees. acos Returns the arccosine of the given number in degrees. atan Returns the arctangent of the given number in degrees. atan2 Returns the arctangent of y/x, given y and x. convert radians to degrees Returns the value in degrees of the given number in radians.

The number of places must be a non-negative integer. The result is produced by rounding the number (if there were too many places) or by adding zeros on the right (if there were too few). is a number Returns true if the given object is a number, and false otherwise. convert number Takes a text string that represents a positive integer in one base and returns a string that represents the same number is another base. For example, if the input string is 10, then converting from base 10 to binary will produce the string 1010; while if the input string is the same 10, then converting from binary to base 10 will produce the string 2.
