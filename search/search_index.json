Kodular is FREE ! Kodular Creator is completely free of charge . You can use it for whatever you want, and we will never ask you to pay us for its usage . We wanted it like that so anyone could convert their desired ideas into apps in a simple way. We think that everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing how to code . That is why our platform is free and it will remain like that forever . This also extends to Kodular Store and Kodular Extensions IDE . Why this business model? Kodular was created to providen accessible suite for everyone to learn and, later, professionally create apps. Due to this, we strongly believe learning to code has to be a right and nobody should have to pay in order to learn the basics of programming. Kodular Creator provides one of the most complete tools in Internet to create apps without coding, and moreover it is being used by tons of students all over the world. Everybody has to be able to make their idea reality independently of their income. Someone can have the next big revolutionary idea, but sometimes without money it cannot be done. We don\u2019t want this to happen. What is fairer? Getting a fixed quota from everyone, without taking into account if they earn something, or taking the proportional earnings people make with our platform? We think the answer is very obvious. We do not earn nothing from people which doesn\u2019t earn anything with our platform. And we only earn from people who monetize their apps, earning money with Kodular Creator. Commissions \u00b6 Updated: 19 January 2019 - 02 May 2019 Due to some technical issues with Google, apps generated with Kodular Creator Versions from Draco 1.3.1 to 1.3B.4, both included, will be free of comission. We will update this page as soon as it gets fixed. Warning All this section will change with the upcoming Kodular update. Please keep in mind this support page may not be up-to-date. However, to keep our services for free, we take a small comission from your earnings in ads . We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings. The components we take commissions from are only Interstitial ones. The other ones are free of commissions. Interstitial ads are the top performing ad types. The percentage of your earnings we take starts from a basic 5% , and increases depending on the number of components and features you use in your app. For example, if an app is very simple, we will only take the 5% of those earnings . But if the app uses all our components and features, the commission will be increased . You can calculate the final commission using this app . You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. We take it automatically using something called \"fallback ads\". Find more information about this here . Premium Plan \u00b6 Since time ago , we have said that Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan . This also extends to Kodular Store . But the Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan . Currently available features will not disappear or will not reduce its features . We will only develop new features for the Premium Plan, for example removing the waiting queue or uploading custom libraries .","title":"Pricing"},{"location":"pricing/#pricing","text":"How much does it cost?

Entries can be added to the empty dictionary using the set value for key block. The create empty dictionary block can also be turned into a make a dictionary block by using the blue mutator button to add pair entries. make a dictionary \u00b6 The make a dictionary is used to create a dictionary with a set of pairs known in advance. Additional entries can be added using set value for key. pair \u00b6 The pair block is a special purpose block used for constructing dictionaries. get value for key \u00b6 The get value for key block checks to see if the dictionary contains a corresponding value for the given key. If it does, the value is returned. Otherwise, the value of the not found parameter is returned. This behavior is similar to the behavior of the lookup in pairs block. set value for key \u00b6 The set value for key block sets the corresponding value for the given key in the dictionary to value. If no mapping exists for key, a new one will be created. Otherwise, the existing value is replaced by the new value. delete entry for key \u00b6 The delete entry for key block removes the key-value mapping in the dictionary for the given key. If no entry for the key exists in the dictionary, the dictionary is not modified. get value at key path \u00b6 The get value at key path block is a more advanced version of the get value for key block. Rather than getting the value of a specific key, it instead takes a list of valid keys and numbers representing a path through a data structure. The get value for key block is equivalent to using this block with a key path of length 1 containing the key. set value for key path \u00b6 The set value for key path block updates the value at a specific key path in a data structure. It is the mirror of get value for key path, which retrieves a value at a specific key path. The path must be valid, except for the last key, which if a mapping does not exist will create a mapping to the new value. Otherwise, the existing value is replaced with the new value. get keys \u00b6 The get keys returns a list of keys in the dictionary. get values \u00b6 The get values returns a list containing the values in the dictionary. Modifying the contents of a value in the list will also modify it in the dictionary. is key in dictionary? \u00b6 The is key in dictionary? tests whether the key exists in the dictionary and returns true if it does, otherwise it returns false. size of dictionary \u00b6 The size of dictionary block returns the number of key-value pairs present in the dictionary. list of pairs to dictionary \u00b6 The list of pairs to dictionary block converts an associative list of the form ((key1 value1) (key2 value2) ...) into a dictionary mapping the keys to their values. Because dictionaries provide better lookup performance than associative lists, if you want to perform many operations on a data structure it is advisable to use this block to convert the associative list into a dictionary first. dictionary to list of pairs \u00b6 The dictionary to list of pairs converts a dictionary into an associative list. This block reverses the conversion performed by the list of pairs to dictionary block. copy dictionary \u00b6 The copy dictionary makes a deep copy of the given dictionary. This means that all of the values are copied recursively and that changing a value in the copy will not change it in the original. merge into dictionary \u00b6 The merge into dictionary from dictionary block copies the key-value pairs from one dictionary into another, overwriting any keys in the target dictionary. list by walking key path \u00b6 The list by walking key path block works similarly to the get value at key path, but creates a list of values rather than returning a single value. It works by starting at the given dictionary and walking down the tree of objects following the given path. Unlike the get value at key path though, its path can be composed of three major types: dictionary keys, list indices, and the walk all at level block. If a key or index is provided, the specific path is taken at that point in the tree. If the walk all at level is specified, every value at that point is followed in succession (breadth-first), at which point the walk continues from the next element in the path. Any element that matches the whole path is added to the output list. walk all at level \u00b6 The walk all at level block is a specialized block that can be used in the key path of a list by walking key path. When encountered during a walk, it causes every item at that level to be explored. For dictionaries, this means that every value is visited. For lists, each item in the list is visited. This can be used to aggregate information from a list of items in a dictionary, such as the first name of every person in a database represented by JSON objects. is a dictionary? \u00b6 The is a dictionary? block tests to see whether the thing given to it is a dictionary or not.

Clicking the blue plus sign will allow you to add additional items to your list. add items to list \u00b6 Adds the given items to the end of the list.

Note that if a list contains sublists, the members of the sublists are not themselves members of the list.

Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. Items are separated by commas. For example, converting the list (a b c d) to a CSV row produces (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\").

For example, converting (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") to a list produces (a b c d). list to csv table \u00b6 Interprets the list as a table in row-major format and returns a CSV (comma-separated value) text representing the table. Each item in the list should itself be a list representing a row of the CSV table. Each item in the row list is considered to be a field, and is quoted with double-quotes in the resulting CSV text. In the returned text, items in rows are separated by commas and rows are separated by CRLF (\\r\\n). list from csv table \u00b6 Parses a text as a CSV (comma-separated value) formatted table to produce a list of rows, each of which is a list of fields. Rows can be separated by newlines (\\n) or CRLF (\\r\\n). lookup in pairs \u00b6 Used for looking up information in a dictionary-like structure represented as a list. This operation takes three inputs, a key , a list pairs , and a notFound result, which by default, is set to \"not found\". Here pairs must be a list of pairs, that is, a list where each element is itself a list of two elements. Lookup in pairs finds the first pair in the list whose first element is the key, and returns the second element. For example, if the list is ((a apple) (d dragon) (b boxcar) (cat 100)) then looking up 'b' will return 'boxcar'.

For example, to have a Ball move 4 pixels toward the top of a Canvas every 500 milliseconds (half second), you would set the Speed property to 4 [pixels], the Interval property to 500 [milliseconds], the Heading property to 90 [degrees], and the Enabled property to True . The difference between a Ball and an ImageSprite is that the latter can get its appearance from an image file, while a Ball 's appearance can be changed only by varying its PaintColor and Radius properties. Events \u00b6 Collided With \u00b6 Event handler called when two enabled sprites (Balls or ImageSprites)collide. Note that checking for collisions with a rotated ImageSprite currentlychecks against its unrotated position. Therefore, collisionchecking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that arerotated. Params other Component Dragged \u00b6 Event handler called when a Ball is dragged. On all calls, the starting coordinates are where the screen was first touched, and the \"current\" coordinates describe the endpoint of the current line segment. On the first call within a given drag, the \"previous\" coordinates are the same as the starting coordinates; subsequently, they are the \"current\" coordinates from the prior call. Note that the Ball won't actually move anywhere in response to the Dragged event unless MoveTo is explicitly called. For smooth movement, each of its coordinates should be set to the sum of its initial value and the difference between its current and previous values. Params start X Number start Y Number prev X Number prev Y Number current X Number current Y Number Edge Reached \u00b6 Event handler called when the Ball reaches an edge of the screen. If Bounce is then called with that edge, the Ball will appear to bounce off of the edge it reached. Edge here is represented as an integer that indicates one of eight directions north (1), northeast (2), east (3), southeast (4), south (-1), southwest (-2), west (-3), and northwest (-4). Params edge Number Flung \u00b6 Event handler called when a fling gesture (quick swipe) is made on an enabled Ball. This provides the x and y coordinates of the start of the fling (relative to the upper left of the canvas), the speed (pixels per millisecond), the heading (0-360 degrees), and the x and y velocity components of the fling's vector. Params x Number y Number speed Number heading Number x vel Number y vel Number No Longer Colliding With \u00b6 Event handler called when a pair of sprites (Balls and ImageSprites) are no longer colliding. Params other Component Touch Down \u00b6 Event handler called when the user begins touching an enabled Ball (placing their finger on a Ball and leaving it there). This provides the x and y coordinates of the touch, relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Touch Up \u00b6 Event handler called when the user stops touching an enabled Ball (lifting their finger after a TouchDown event). This provides the x and y coordinates of the touch, relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Touched \u00b6 Event handler called when the user touches an enabled Ball and then immediately lifts their finger. The provided x and y coordinates are relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Methods \u00b6 Bounce \u00b6 Makes the Ball bounce, as if off a wall. For normal bouncing, the edge argument should be the one returned by EdgeReached. Params edge Number Colliding With \u00b6 Returns: Boolean Indicates whether a collision has been registered between this Ball and the passed sprite (Ball or ImageSprite). Params other Component Move Into Bounds \u00b6 Moves the Ball back in bounds if part of it extends out of bounds, having no effect otherwise. If the Ball is too wide to fit on the canvas, this aligns the left side of the Ball with the left side of the canvas. If the Ball is too tall to fit on the canvas, this aligns the top side of the Ball with the top side of the canvas. Move To \u00b6 Sets the x and y coordinates of the Ball. If CenterAtOrigin is true, the center of the Ball will be placed here. Otherwise, the top left edge of the Ball will be placed at the specified coordinates. Params x Number y Number Point In Direction \u00b6 Sets the heading of the Ball toward the point with the coordinates (x, y). Params x Number y Number Point Towards \u00b6 Turns the Ball to point towards a designated target sprite (Ball or ImageSprite). The new heading will be parallel to the line joining the centerpoints of the two sprites. Params target Component Properties \u00b6 Enabled \u00b6 Boolean Default: True Read Write - Designer Blocks Controls whether the Ball moves and can be interacted with through collisions, dragging, touching, and flinging. Heading \u00b6 Number Default: 0 Read Write - Designer Blocks Sets heading in which sprite should move. In addition to changing thelocal variables Interval \u00b6 Number Default: 100 Read Write - Designer Blocks The interval in milliseconds at which the Ball's position is updated. For example, if the interval is 50 and the speed is 10, then every 50 milliseconds the sprite will move 10 pixels in the heading direction. Origin At Center \u00b6 Boolean Default: False Write - Designer Whether the x- and y-coordinates should represent the center of the Ball ( true ) or its left and top edges ( false ). Paint Color \u00b6 Color Default: #000000FF Read Write - Designer Blocks The color of the Ball. Radius \u00b6 Number Default: 5 Read Write - Designer Blocks The distance from the edge of the Ball to its center. Speed \u00b6 Number Default: 0.0 Read Write - Designer Blocks The number of pixels that the Ball should move every interval, if enabled. Visible \u00b6 Boolean Default: True Read Write - Designer Blocks Whether the Ball is visible. X \u00b6 Number Default: 0.0 Read Write - Designer Blocks The horizontal coordinate of the Ball, increasing as the Ball moves right. If the property OriginAtCenter is true, the coodinate is for the center of the Ball; otherwise, it is for the leftmost point of the Ball. Y \u00b6 Number Default: 0.0 Read Write - Designer Blocks The vertical coordinate of the Ball, increasing as the Ball moves down. If the property OriginAtCenter is true, the coodinate is for the center of the Ball; otherwise, it is for the uppermost point of the Ball.

Its appearance is that of the image specified in its Picture property (unless its Visible property is False ). To have an ImageSprite move 10 pixels to the left every 1000 milliseconds (one second), for example, you would set the Speed property to 10 [pixels], the Interval property to 1000 [milliseconds], the Heading property to 180 [degrees], and the Enabled property to True . A sprite whose Rotates property is True will rotate its image as the sprite's Heading changes. Checking for collisions with a rotated sprite currently checks the sprite's unrotated position so that collision checking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that are rotated. Any of the sprite properties can be changed at any time under program control. Permissions android.permission.INTERNET Events \u00b6 Collided With \u00b6 Event handler called when two enabled sprites (Balls or ImageSprites)collide. Note that checking for collisions with a rotated ImageSprite currentlychecks against its unrotated position. Therefore, collisionchecking will be inaccurate for tall narrow or short wide sprites that arerotated. Params other Component Dragged \u00b6 Event handler called when a ImageSprite is dragged. On all calls, the starting coordinates are where the screen was first touched, and the \"current\" coordinates describe the endpoint of the current line segment. On the first call within a given drag, the \"previous\" coordinates are the same as the starting coordinates; subsequently, they are the \"current\" coordinates from the prior call. Note that the ImageSprite won't actually move anywhere in response to the Dragged event unless MoveTo is explicitly called. For smooth movement, each of its coordinates should be set to the sum of its initial value and the difference between its current and previous values. Params start X Number start Y Number prev X Number prev Y Number current X Number current Y Number Edge Reached \u00b6 Event handler called when the ImageSprite reaches an edge of the screen. If Bounce is then called with that edge, the ImageSprite will appear to bounce off of the edge it reached. Edge here is represented as an integer that indicates one of eight directions north (1), northeast (2), east (3), southeast (4), south (-1), southwest (-2), west (-3), and northwest (-4). Params edge Number Flung \u00b6 Event handler called when a fling gesture (quick swipe) is made on an enabled ImageSprite. This provides the x and y coordinates of the start of the fling (relative to the upper left of the canvas), the speed (pixels per millisecond), the heading (0-360 degrees), and the x and y velocity components of the fling's vector. Params x Number y Number speed Number heading Number x vel Number y vel Number No Longer Colliding With \u00b6 Event handler called when a pair of sprites (Balls and ImageSprites) are no longer colliding. Params other Component Touch Down \u00b6 Event handler called when the user begins touching an enabled ImageSprite (placing their finger on a ImageSprite and leaving it there). This provides the x and y coordinates of the touch, relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Touch Up \u00b6 Event handler called when the user stops touching an enabled ImageSprite (lifting their finger after a TouchDown event). This provides the x and y coordinates of the touch, relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Touched \u00b6 Event handler called when the user touches an enabled ImageSprite and then immediately lifts their finger. The provided x and y coordinates are relative to the upper left of the canvas. Params x Number y Number Methods \u00b6 Bounce \u00b6 Makes the ImageSprite bounce, as if off a wall. For normal bouncing, the edge argument should be the one returned by EdgeReached. Params edge Number Colliding With \u00b6 Returns: Boolean Indicates whether a collision has been registered between this ImageSprite and the passed sprite (Ball or ImageSprite). Params other Component Move Into Bounds \u00b6 Moves the ImageSprite back in bounds if part of it extends out of bounds, having no effect otherwise. If the ImageSprite is too wide to fit on the canvas, this aligns the left side of the ImageSprite with the left side of the canvas. If the ImageSprite is too tall to fit on the canvas, this aligns the top side of the ImageSprite with the top side of the canvas. Move To \u00b6 Moves the ImageSprite so that its left top corner is at the specfied x and y coordinates. Params x Number y Number Point In Direction \u00b6 Sets the heading of the ImageSprite toward the point with the coordinates (x, y). Params x Number y Number Point Towards \u00b6 Turns the ImageSprite to point towards a designated target sprite (Ball or ImageSprite). The new heading will be parallel to the line joining the centerpoints of the two sprites. Params target Component Properties \u00b6 Enabled \u00b6 Boolean Default: True Read Write - Designer Blocks Controls whether the ImageSprite moves and can be interacted with through collisions, dragging, touching, and flinging. Heading \u00b6 Number Default: 0 Read Write - Designer Blocks Sets heading in which sprite should move. In addition to changing thelocal variables Height \u00b6 Number Read Write - Blocks The height of the ImageSprite in pixels. Interval \u00b6 Number Default: 100 Read Write - Designer Blocks The interval in milliseconds at which the ImageSprite's position is updated. For example, if the interval is 50 and the speed is 10, then every 50 milliseconds the sprite will move 10 pixels in the heading direction. Picture \u00b6 Text Read Write - Designer Blocks The picture that determines the ImageSprite's appearance. Rotates \u00b6 Boolean Default: True Read Write - Designer Blocks Whether the image should rotate to match the ImageSprite's heading. The sprite rotates around its centerpoint. Speed \u00b6 Number Default: 0.0 Read Write - Designer Blocks The number of pixels that the ImageSprite should move every interval, if enabled.

If your media files are too large, you may get errors when packaging or installing your application, in which case you should reduce the number of media files or their sizes. Most video editing software, such as Windows Movie Maker and Apple iMovie, can help you decrease the size of videos by shortening them or re-encoding the video into a more compact format.

Finally if ReceivingEnabled is set to 3, messages will be received when the application is running and when the application is not running they will be queued and a notification displayed to the user. When a message arrives, the MessageReceived event is raised and provides the sending number and message. An app that includes this component will receive messages even when it is in the background (i.e. when it's not visible on the screen) and, moreso, even if the app is not running, so long as it's installed on the phone. If the phone receives a text message when the app is not in the foreground, the phone will show a notification in the notification bar. Selecting the notification will bring up the app. As an app developer, you'll probably want to give your users the ability to control ReceivingEnabled so that they can make the phone ignore text messages. If the GoogleVoiceEnabled property is true, messages can be sent over Wifi using Google Voice. This option requires that the user have a Google Voice account and that the mobile Voice app is installed on the phone. The Google Voice option works only on phones that support Android 2.0 (Eclair) or higher. To specify the phone number (e.g., 650-555-1212), set the PhoneNumber property to a Text string with the specified digits (e.g., 6505551212). Dashes, dots, and parentheses may be included (e.g., (650)-555-1212) but will be ignored; spaces may not be included.

In contrast, TinyDB is a _ persistent _ data store for the app, that is, the data stored there will be available each time the app is run.

The Component 's behaviour is configured using Blocks Components + Blocks = Your Awesome App! What are Components ? \u00b6 Components are the basic building elements of any app in Kodular. Everything in the app is done with the help of one component or the other. Different components are used for different purposes. One component may be used to design the User Interface(UI) of the app, for example a Button component, while others may be used for performing actions like communicating to a database, saving an image to the Android device's folder etc. for example the FirebaseDB component. What are Blocks ? \u00b6 Blocks are ones which are used describe how to do a task. The way in which the Components respond to various actions and events in the app is designed using the Blocks . For example, how the app should respond when a Button is clicked, what data is to be communicated to the database using FirebaseDB component etc. are all configured using the Blocks . Thus, by using the various Components and by configuring its behaviour and response to actions from the user with the help of Blocks , an app is \"koded\" in Kodular. The Car Analogy \u00b6 Let us consider an analogy of a Car to better understand the concept of the components and blocks. A Car is constructed using various parts, like wheels, doors, engine, steering etc. each performing its own unique function. Some of these parts are visible to the driver(who is the user of the car) and he interacts with them directly, while some of them are not visible. And these parts know what their function is and how to perform it, for example, the function of the wheel is to provide support and move the car, the function of the steering wheel is to help streer the car and so on. An Android app is like the Car. Like how a car has various parts, an app is constructed using various Components , like Button, Label, File etc. with each component being used for a particular purpose. Like the parts of the Car, some of these Components are visible to the user of the app and they interact with it, while some of the components don't interact directly with the user. The behaviour or the purpose of these components are configured using the Blocks . The \"how to perform the function of a component\" part is configured by using the Blocks . Types of Components \u00b6 Visible Components : The components that can be viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Visible Component. They are visible to the user in the app and the user can interact with it directly and help in building the User Interface of the app. Non-Visible Components : The components that are not viewed in the Viewer panel of the Designer page are known as Non-Visible Component. They are the components that usually do other things like saving a file to the device's storage, getting data from various sensors of the device etc. But, sometimes, these components may also be used to create visible elements in the app. For example, the Notifier component, which is a Non-visible Component can be used to create a dialog which is visible on the device's screen. Types of Blocks of components \u00b6 Each Component has its own set of blocks, divided into three types: Property blocks Method blocks Event blocks Property Blocks \u00b6 Each component comes with its own set of Properties , which describe its characteristics. For example, the Button component has properties like Background Color, Text Color, Text Font Size etc. which are characteristics that describe the features of that particular button. Some these Properties can either be set from Designer page, or through Blocks , while some can be set only through Blocks and some only from the Designer . The Setter and Getter block for the Background Color property of a button. At any time in the app, the given property of a component can be read through a Getter Block . It gives the current value of that property of that particular component . Similarly, the given property of a component can be modified during the runtime of the app thorugh Setter Blocks . The Property blocks are Green in color. Info Not all the properties of the component have both Getter and Setter Blocks. Some of them may have only Getter or sometimes only Setter blocks. Method Blocks \u00b6 Methods are certain functions that a component can do. For example, the Sound component should be able to play the music when required. This is done by using a Method called Play , which instructs the components to carry out the task of playing the music. So, Methods are nothing but an instruction to carry out a particular task, like playing the music. Some methods require some additional data, which will also be used in carrying out that task. For example, Firebase DB component stores the data using a method called Store Value . But how will the component know what data to store and under what name ? This is where Parameters or simply Params are used. The Store Value methods has takes two parameters (i.e it makes use of two different data that need to be specified) namely tag and value To Store . So this method can be called (i.e used in the blocks) along with the two data that it needs like shown below. The Method to store data in the Firebase DB. Event Blocks \u00b6 Kodular apps are \"koded\" in an event-driven approach. That is, the blocks or behaviour of the app is executed based on the various events that occur. There is a wide range of events that occur thorughout the time for which the app is running, and the response of the app to these events can be configured. For example, the user clicking a Button , the app starting are all events. The response of the app to such events are configured by grouping the desired behaviour under the Event block. The methods and property blocks grouped under each event are executed whenever that particular event occurs. Let us take an example. If you want to change the Button text when the user clicks it, you have to group the logic to change the text under the Button.Clicked event. This is shown below. The Event block for changing button text when clicked.

Tip At this point, we recommend going through the Understanding Kodular page to get an overview of developing apps in Kodular. The User Interface of Kodular Creator \u00b6 First, let us walk thorough the Designer UI of Kodular Creator. The above shown screen is called Designer . From this page, you can add/delete Components and modify their properties. On the left side of your page, numbered 1 is the Components Palette or simply Palette . This consists of various components grouped under different categories. When you need to add a component, you can click on the component on the Palette , hold it and drag it onto the Viewer area of the Designer page. On the right side, you have the Components Hierarchy and the Designer Properties Panel (which is visible when you select a component ). The Components Hierarchy shows the visible components added into the current project . The Designer Properties Panel will be visible when clicking on a component and displays the properties of that component. In the middle is the Viewer which gives a mocked up view of the app as seen on a real device. To add a component to the project , drag the component from the Palette and drop it inside the Viewer . Below the Viewer , the Non-visible Components Panel is present, which shows all the Non-Visible Components added to the current project . At the top of the page, various menus and options are present. Building the app \u00b6 Now that we are familiar with the interface, we can get to work and create a simple app, with a Button which shows the text \"Hello World\". Step 1 Find the Button component from the Palette under the User Interface category. Click on it, and drag it onto the Viewer , while keeping the mouse button clicked down. This is how you add a component to the project. Step 2 Now click on the Button1 displayed on the Components Hierarchy . By default, this is how the components are named, you can rename them if needed. The Properties Panel for the Button should be visible now. Step 3 Now, find the Text property in that panel and change that to Hello World! . If you have connected your companion and testing using it, then now the change should be reflected on the device. Step 4 Now, you can select Export menu from the top menubar to build your project into an APK, which can be installed in an Android device.

Go to My Kodular, head to the Payments page, and make sure your account is eligible. Some of the reasons why your account may not be eligible are: You have no approved apps for monetization. You have way too many apps rejected for monetization. If your account is eligible, you may see a \"Request Invite\" button. Follow the setup instructions to create the Google Ad Manager Child Account, and wait until it gets approved by Google. This process should take around 2 business days . Warning Make sure you no longer hold a Google Ad Manager account. If so, ask to create a new one. Once all the process has been completed, your account will be ready to show ads . Registering your app in Google Ad Manager \u00b6 The next step is applying for a Google Ads App ID. To do so, head to the Google Ad Manager console , and go to Inventory>Apps section.

You will be making a simple news application that lists the top 20 news articles trending globally. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with APIs and the Web Component Working with the JSON component Working with Dynamic Labels, Buttons, and Images Caution This is guide covers advanced topics like dynamic components and web APIs. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. First steps \u00b6 We will be using the News API to fetch the trending headlines. Head over to https://newsapi.org/ > to get an API key. Warning You will not be able to monetize apps which use the News API . To place ads in apps that use this API, you will have to switch to their paid plan first. More information is available here The API endpoint we'll be using in this guide is https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?language=en&apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY} This is what a sample response looks like: {\"status\":\"ok\", \"totalResults\":TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_ARTICLES, \"articles\":[ {\"source\": {\"id\":\"SOURCE_ID\",\"name\":\"SOURCE_NAME\"}, \"author\":AUTHOR_NAME, \"title\":\"ARTICLE_TITLE\", \"description\":\"ARTICLE_SUMMARY\", \"urlToImage\":\"ARTICLE_IMAGE\", \"publishedAt\":\"ARTICLE_PUBLISH_DATE\", \"content\":\"ARTICLE_CONTENT\" }, {...} ]} We will need the article title , description , and urlToImage to populate the cards. We'll be using the JSON component to extract data from the API. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. Drag and drop the Vertical Scroll Arrangement , Web , JSON , Dynamic Label , Dynamic Image , and Dynamic Card View components. Set the Vertical Scroll Arrangement 's height and width designer properties to Fill Parent , and its Align Vertical property to Center . In the Dynamic Card View 's designer properties, set the Corner Radius to 5 and the Elevation to 0. Finally, enable its Full Clickable designer property. Finally, add an Image Utilities component which we will use to load images asynchronously This is what your designer should look like The top 20 news articles will be displayed as Dynamic Card View s, which will be loaded inside the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Each card will include the article's title, a short description, and a header image. Coding the blocks \u00b6 We will need a variable to store the JSON response from the API. This can be a simple Text variable like so. The API data is to be fetched when the screen initializes. Set the Web component's url to the API url, and perform the GET request. When the Web component has fetched the data, set the response content to the global variable you created. In case there was an issue getting the content, we set the variable to custom error JSON. This is so that the JSON parsing, which has to be done later, doesn't throw errors. Next, we need a procedure that populates the Vertical Scroll Arrangement with cards. This procedure will iterate 20 times if there are more than 20 news articles in the api response variable. If there are less than 20 articles, the procedure will only iterate through the number of articles in the api response. We call this procedure inside the Web component's Got Text block. Next, we create another procedure which takes the JSON object and the array index as parameters. This procedure will create the cards for us and add them to the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Tip It is recommended you place blocks in procedures so that they are more readable and can be used several times. For each news article, we first create a card view that holds all the content we wish to show. Use the Create Card View block inside the procedure to make a dynamic card for each article. Each card will be 90% of the screen's width and will have automatic height so that it can resize according to the content inside. Next, we create a dynamic image that contains the article's header image. We use the Image Utilities component to load the images asynchronously from the URL, so that the UI doesn't lag while the data is being fetched. Using the Dynamic Label component, we create dynamic labels for each card which contain the article's title. Since this the article's title, we set the font size to 18. Tip It is recommended you set the html parameter to False when getting data from external sources. Unchecked HTML can be used to perform unauthorized actions in your app. We use the Dynamic Label component one more time to create a label for the description. We set the id to a value that we are certain hasn't been used yet. If you are showing the top 200 news articles, then you might want to start your id's from 1000 (or a similarly appropriate number). Finally, we place the procedure call block inside the PopulateNewsArticles procedure. Conclusion \u00b6 The finished project All the blocks we've used Hooray! You've successfully made an app that uses dynamic card views! Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide. How to create dynamic card views.

To place ads in apps that use this API, you will have to switch to their paid plan first. More information is available here The API endpoint we'll be using in this guide is https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?language=en&apiKey={YOUR_API_KEY} This is what a sample response looks like: {\"status\":\"ok\", \"totalResults\":TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_ARTICLES, \"articles\":[ {\"source\": {\"id\":\"SOURCE_ID\",\"name\":\"SOURCE_NAME\"}, \"author\":AUTHOR_NAME, \"title\":\"ARTICLE_TITLE\", \"description\":\"ARTICLE_SUMMARY\", \"urlToImage\":\"ARTICLE_IMAGE\", \"publishedAt\":\"ARTICLE_PUBLISH_DATE\", \"content\":\"ARTICLE_CONTENT\" }, {...} ]} We will need the article title , description , and urlToImage to populate the cards.

Drag and drop the Vertical Scroll Arrangement , Web , JSON , Dynamic Label , Dynamic Image , and Dynamic Card View components. Set the Vertical Scroll Arrangement 's height and width designer properties to Fill Parent , and its Align Vertical property to Center . In the Dynamic Card View 's designer properties, set the Corner Radius to 5 and the Elevation to 0. Finally, enable its Full Clickable designer property. Finally, add an Image Utilities component which we will use to load images asynchronously This is what your designer should look like The top 20 news articles will be displayed as Dynamic Card View s, which will be loaded inside the Vertical Scroll Arrangement .

This can be a simple Text variable like so. The API data is to be fetched when the screen initializes. Set the Web component's url to the API url, and perform the GET request. When the Web component has fetched the data, set the response content to the global variable you created. In case there was an issue getting the content, we set the variable to custom error JSON. This is so that the JSON parsing, which has to be done later, doesn't throw errors. Next, we need a procedure that populates the Vertical Scroll Arrangement with cards. This procedure will iterate 20 times if there are more than 20 news articles in the api response variable. If there are less than 20 articles, the procedure will only iterate through the number of articles in the api response. We call this procedure inside the Web component's Got Text block. Next, we create another procedure which takes the JSON object and the array index as parameters. This procedure will create the cards for us and add them to the Vertical Scroll Arrangement . Tip It is recommended you place blocks in procedures so that they are more readable and can be used several times. For each news article, we first create a card view that holds all the content we wish to show. Use the Create Card View block inside the procedure to make a dynamic card for each article.

Unlike SQL or other conventional database services, Firebase database does not employ a username/password based system to validate modifications to data. Instead, Firebase uses a highly intuitive rules-based system that ensures your data can be used only by those who you authorize. How does it work \u00b6 Firebase Rules are written in JSON and JavaScript. They work alongside Firebase Authentication to restrict read/write access to specific users. It is also possible to validate data before writing it to the database. In this guide, we'll take a look at the different rules one can use to secure their data, and some best practices while writing rules. Use cases for Firebase Rules \u00b6 Testing mode \u00b6 Testing your app is easy when you have full access to your database. To enable read/write access to all tags, use: { \"rules\": { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : true, } } Info All your rules should be wrapped inside the \"rules\" tag. Read rules are always set using the \".read\" tag, and write with \".write\" . The JSON code above specifies two rules for your entire database. Each rule can be thought of as a condition that has to return true if the operation is to succeed. In the case above, both .read and .write always return true , meaning no checks are required before accessing your database. Warning Never set read and write to true in a production environment. Your database can be hacked easily and worse, can be wiped clean by unauthorized users. Authenticated-only mode \u00b6 You can enable only authenticated users to read and write tags in your database. Users can be authenticated using the Firebase Authentication component. { \"rules\": { \".read\" : \"auth.uid != null\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid != null\", } } Every authenticated user has a unique \"uid\". If the uid of the current user is null , then they haven't been authenticated. Such users will not be allowed to read/write data. This is the default Firebase setting. The uid of a user can be accessed from the user ID variable in the Login Success and Current User Success blocks in the Firebase Authentication component. Caution These rules are barely more secure than the testing mode rules. Note that your users can still access all tags and values (including other users' personal data), and can still potentially clear your entire database. Uid-Tag mode \u00b6 You can also write rules to restrict read and write access to specific tags. With such rules, you can ensure that the user can edit only the data which they have created. Considering this database: - users - U43gnonNP9joboLnv - ranking : 1 - email : \"example@example.ex\" - age : 20 - greuo80NOpwqM8100 - ranking : 67 - email : \"something@someone.com\" - age : 15 - kpmkmnn2YIHVI542a - ranking : 2 - email : \"user@product.io\" - age : 45 - challenges - FindingNemo - name : \"Finding Nemo\" - recommended_age: 15 - Marathon - name : \"25mi Marathon\" - recommended_age: 20 The structure of the database is: - users - uid - ranking - email - age - challenges - challengeId - name - recommended_age Every user has their own tag (which is identified by their uid), and each tag contains data about the user. We want users to be able to edit only their data, meaning a user with uid U43gnonNP9joboLnv should be able to edit the ranking, email, and age only for the tag with the name U43gnonNP9joboLnv . However, we wish to let all users see the challenges, but not let anyone edit them (challenges are edited directly from the Firebase console/CLI). Here is how you would write the rules for such a system. Start off with read/write rules for the users tag. { \"rules\" : { \"users\" : { \"$user_id\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\" } } } } The $user_id tag is a wildcard reference to all keys that are inside the users tag. We allow read and write operations only if the name of the tag (as specified in $user_id ) equals of the uid of the authenticated user. This way, a user will not be able to access tags that are not theirs as auth.uid will not be the name of the tag. On the other hand, challenges can be read by all and written by none. \"challenges\" : { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : false } The final JSON object will look like { \"rules\" : { \"users\" : { \"$user_id\" : { \".read\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\", \".write\" : \"auth.uid == $user_id\" }, \"challenges\" : { \".read\" : true, \".write\" : false } } } } Data validation \u00b6 With Firebase Rules, you can validate user data before it is sent to the database. Firebase provides two variables for this purpose: data and newData . data This variable holds the current value of the database tag. You can use data.val() to fetch the value, or use data.hasChild(child) to check if it has the specified child. Firebase also provides several other functions you can use on your data. More information can be found here newData This variable holds the value the user is attempting to write to the database. newData also supports val , hasChild , and other functions that data has. Best practices \u00b6 Avoid overlap \u00b6 Due to the nature of how Firebase database works, a rule set on a certain tag applies to all of its children. In the example used in Uid-Tag mode , we've set read/write conditions to the \"challenges\" tag. These rules apply to all challenges inside the tag, and to every name and recommended_age inside each challenge. It is not possible to override rules for child tags if a parent tag already has a rule. In essence, Firebase Rules are applied top to bottom. Shallower rules overwrite deeper ones. It is thus advised to structure your database such that you group tags that have similar rules. For example, your database can have two main tags: public and private , and deny read access to all tags inside private . Thus, you will be writing fewer rules and avoiding redundant ones. The more complex your database structure is, the harder it is to write coherent rules that do not have loopholes or security flaws. Avoid unauthenticated access \u00b6 It is always better to set a rule to auth.uid != null instead of true . While both are nearly the same, the former prevents unauthorized users from accessing your data. So in case something goes wrong, you will know for certain that it was one of your authenticated users who caused it. Give limited access \u00b6 Write your rules such that your users can access only that data which they can view. It is not recommended to give your users access to your entire database. Lock access in development \u00b6 Set all rules to false in a development environment where you would not want anyone to edit your database. It is also suggested you lock your database if your product is shutting down. Note You will still be able to access and edit your database either from your Firebase console or from the command-line interface (CLI). Conclusion \u00b6 Firebase Rules are great for securing your database and channeling users to the right tags and values. With the right set of rules, your database will be practically unhackable!

With staged updates, you can control which users see the update based on their country, age, etc., or choose to show updates only to a percentage of your users chosen at random. Staged updates are useful when introducing new features, especially for projects without a dedicated beta testing program. You will be able to gather useful feedback from your random testing group before your release is made available to all. Moreover, you will be able to roll back any \"failed\" updates without causing major issues. Why Firebase Remote Config? \u00b6 Firebase Remote Config lets you enable and disable features to specific users without having them update the app. These features can be both minor (like a new social login provider) and major (like a total redesign of your app). Remote Config is very similar to the OTA update system Android device manufacturers use to update your Android version. You will be making a simple app with a tab layout. Using the Firebase Remote Config component, you will then show a bottom navigation instead of the tab layout to 20% of your users. You will also learn how to release the update to all users, and also to roll-back the changes. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with Firebase Working with the Tab Layout and Bottom Navigation components Caution This is guide covers advanced topics like Firebase, staged rollouts, and generic blocks. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. First steps \u00b6 Head over to your Firebase Console to set up Remote Config for your Firebase project. If you do not have an existing project, create a new one. Use the navigation menu on the left to go to the Remote Config section. Firebase Remote Config works using parameters and values . Your will app will fetch the value of a parameter and then decide how to proceed. Firebase can send different value s to different users, based on some conditions you can set. In this guide, we will create a parameter called bottom_nav_enabled , which returns false for all users except the 20% chosen at random. Give the parameter a name Next, add a condition to your parameter . Every conditon has a name, so that it can be identified easily when several are being used. We will name our condition random_testers_group . There are several constraints to choose from, but for this guide, we will restrict ourselves to \"User in random percentile\". Add a condition Tip It is possible to chain several constraints in a single condition using the \"and\" button. Your parameter can now have two value s: one for those in the random_testers_group , and another for everybody else. Set the value to \"true\" for the testers, and \"false\" for others. Add values to your parameter Finally, click on \"Add parameter\", and then click \"Publish changes\". Publish your changes Warning Publishing your changes will make them live to all your users. Make sure you check everything twice before publishing! That's it for the Firebase part. Now let's move to building your app. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. Drag and drop the Tab Layout , Bottom Navigation , and Firebase Remote Config components. Also add three Vertical Arrangement components to the Screen . They will function as the different \"sub-views\" of the app which can be accessed using the Tab Layout or Bottom Navigation . Give each Vertical Arrangement a distinct background color, and set their heights and widths to Fill Parent . Ensure only one arrangement is visible at a time, so set the Visible property of two arrangements to False . Finally, set the Visible property of the Bottom Navigation component to False . By default, users will navigate your app using the tab layout. We change this behavior for the random testers group from the Blocks Editor. Warning You will have to upload the google-services.json file to Assets to be able to export your app. This file can be obtained from your Firebase Console. This is what your designer should look like Coding the blocks \u00b6 We first create all the tabs when the screen initializes. In this guide, we have three tabs: Home, Products, and Cart. Next, we handle \"selections\" on the tabs using a procedure which takes the id of the tab as an input. We loop through all the vertical arrangements and set their Visible property to False . Then, we get the selected tab item and its corresponding arrangement, and set its Visible property to True . Generic blocks make it easier to manipulate the visibility of the components, especially in apps with several tabs. We call this procedure from the Tab Layout component's Tab Item Selected event. We do the same for the Bottom Navigation component: first add the menu items (in the Screen's Initialize event), and then handle the selection event. Info The icon assets for the navigation items are provided in the AIA in the Downloads section. We can use the same prodcedure we made for the Tab Layout . Now for the important bit. We use the Firebase Remote Config component to get the visibility status of the Bottom Navigation component. Before we use any of the parameters, we need to fetch all data from Firebase. Place the fetch block in the Screen's Initialize event to do so. Once the data has been fetched, we get the value of the bottom_navigation_enabled parameter. Since this is a boolean parameter, we use the Get Boolean block to retrieve the value. This value can be either True or False , depending on the status of the user. If the user is in the randomly chosen 20% (our random_testers_group ), then True is returned, False otherwise. If the value is True , we show the Bottom Navigation instead of the Tab Layout . Note Updates to parameters can take a few hours to update across all devices, so don't be alarmed if you don't see all changes immediately. Conclusion \u00b6 What a regular user sees (left) vs what a randomly chosen beta tester sees (right) All the blocks we've used in this guide Releasing the update to everyone \u00b6 To release the changes to all your users, simply go to your Firebase Console and remove the condition from the parameter so that it always returns true. Setting the parameter to true by default Rolling back updates \u00b6 To roll back the update you've made, remove the condition from the parameter and set the default value to false. This ensures nobody sees the Bottom Navigation anymore. Removing the condition so that the parameter always returns false Congratulations! You've successfully learnt to stage your app updates and release features to select users! Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide. How to set up Remote Config in Firebase. How to show features only to a few users. How to create a simple screen with a Tab Layout and a Bottom Navigation. How to fetch the Remote Config parameters. How to use the fetched data to change the layout of your app during runtime. Next steps \u00b6 Want ideas for making this app better? We have some things for you to try. Add more constraints to your condition. For example, show the Bottom Navigation to 20% of your users from the USA. Create more parameters and values. Add language based constraints. For instance, show a link to a German-English dictionary in your app if the user is from Germany. Roll back features and release them to all your users. Add a feedback form to your app so that users can share their thoughts on the Bottom Navigation . Ensure that the feedback form is shown only to users who see the Bottom Navigation !

Rules are a JSON and JavaScript based system that allow you to restrict database access to certain tags and/or users. You will be making a simple app that lets users sign in with Firebase Authentication and saves their data in the real-time database. Then, you will write some rules to prevent others from accessing sensitive user data. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Working with Firebase Database and Authentication Working with Firebase Rules Caution This is guide covers advanced Firebase topics. For sake of keeping this guide at a readable length, some basic instructions will be glossed over with the assumption that you are aware of the workings of other components. If not, please take a look at more basic guides before getting started here. Take a look at our guide on working with Firebase Rules for an introduction to the rules system. First steps \u00b6 Head over to your Firebase Console to set up a real-time database for your Firebase project. If you do not have an existing project, create a new one. Use the navigation menu on the left to go to the Database section. In case the real-time database has not been enabled already, scroll to the bottom and click on \"Realtime database\". You will be using Google login for user authentication. Go to the Authentication section using the menu on the left, and enable Google as an authentication provider. More details on Google authentication can be found here . Enable Google login Database structure \u00b6 For this tutorial, we will store a tag for each user who signs-up in the app. The tag will be identified by the user's unique id, and will contain their name, email, and the Android version of their device. We wish to keep the users' names public, but their email and Android version private. Here is what our database will look like: - bucket_name - uid - name - email - android_version - uids uids will be an array of all unique ids that are in the database. We will use this tag later to iterate through all users and get their names. That's all the Firebase for now. Let's move to building your app. We'll come back to the Firebase console later to write the rules. Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. We will need three buttons for this project - one to sign the user in, another to send their details to the database, and one more to fetch the names of all users in the database. Drag and drop three Button components and name them SignInButton , UpdateDetailsButton , and GetDetailsButton . Next, drop a Text Box where the user will be able to enter their name. Then, add a Notifier component and rename it to MessageNotifier . We will use this component to display the names of all users. Finally, drop the Firebase Database , Firebase Authentication , and Device Utilities components. The Device Utilities component will be used to fetch the Android version of the user's device. Warning You will have to upload the google-services.json file to Assets to be able to export your app. This file can be obtained from your Firebase Console. This is what your designer should look like Tip The components shown above have been styled with colors and borders to make them look better. Download AIA from the bottom of the page to use them in your app! Coding the blocks \u00b6 First, we add an event block to handle clicks on the SignInButton . The user is to be shown a prompt to sign in with Google. Once the login is successful, we append the user's unique id to the uids tag in the database. Next, we handle clicks on the UpdateDetailsButton . When the button is clicked, we first fetch the user's details so that we can get their uid. Then, using the uid, we update their name, email, and Android version. Note As of now, a user can fetch the list of all uids and update the details of any other user. We will be writing Firebase rules later to ensure the data a user can edit is limited to their uid. Finally, we code the recursive function to get the names of all the users. Note that we cannot use the Get Tag List block as the rules we will be writing will block direct access to these tags. To get the names of all the users, we will need two lists: one for all uids and another for all names. We initiate the recursion using the Click event block for the GetDetailsButton . When the value has been fetched, we populate the list of uids, and then fetch the name of the first uid in the list. We do the same for each uid in the list. Every time we fetch the name of the uid, we remove the uid from the list and add the name to the names list. Once all names have been fetched, we show them in a message dialog. Writing the rules \u00b6 Head back to your Firebase console. In the Realtime Database section, navigate to the \"rules\" tab. By default, Firebase allows full read/write access. If you created your database in locked mode, the default rules will allow only authenticated users, and your rules will look something like: { \"rules\": { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"auth != null\", } } Neither of them are secure because all your users have access to all data in your database. Let's fix this with a few rules. To start off, replace the currently set rules with a blank template as shown below: { \"rules\": { } } Next, change the rules as shown to target all tags in your project bucket. Replace *PROJECT_BUCKET* with your bucket name. (The bucket name can be found in the designer properties of the Firebase Database component). { \"rules\": { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\": { //... to be added later } } } Rules for users' details \u00b6 We wish for a user to be able to edit only their details. Each user has a tag for themselves, which is named as their uid. Thus, a user should only be able to edit the tag which belongs to them. We can use wildcard keys to select any tag inside your project bucket, as shown below: { \"rules\": { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\": { \"$uid\": { } } } } A user should be able to edit only their name and nobody else's, but all authenticated users should be able to view every user's name. We can restrict read/write operations accordingly with this rule: \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } However, the email and Android version should have restricted read and write access. \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } Our list of rules currently looks like this: { \"rules\": { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\": { \"$uid\": { \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } } } } } Let's take an example of a sample database to see how the rules work. The database currently has the following data: { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\" : { \"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwas@kodular.io\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Vishwas\\\"\" }, \"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"9.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"helios@helios.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Helios\\\"\" }, \"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwasadiga@gmail.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Mr. Example\\\"\" }, \"uids\" : \"[\\\"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\\\", \\\"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\\\", \\\"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\\\"]\" } } A user currently authenticated with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 is able to fetch their own name, email, and Android version: The user is also able to edit the value of their name, email, and Android version. In addition, the user can access the names of other users, say, one with the uid KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62 . But they cannot get the email or Android version of other users. Nor can they set the name, email, or Android version of other users. Rules for list of uids \u00b6 Every user should be able to access the list of all uids, but should not be allowed to spam the list with random values. We can validate the data to ensure the user is appending their uid to the list, and not any other value. Validation can be done using the following rule: \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } With the rule set, all authenticated users will be able to read the value of the uids list. An authenticated user can also append their uid to the list. However, no other value except the user's uid can be entered. In essence, the newData variable must have a child that is the user's uid, which guarantees that the appended list has the correct uid. The current implementation, however, adds the user's unique id to the list every time they login. To keep only unique values of the uid, we prevent users from writing duplicates. The .write rule can be changed from \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" to \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" This ensures that the uid is written only if the current data doesn't already contain it. Let's illustrate with the example of a user with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 . The user can append their uid to the list of all uids But cannot append anything other than their uid Our final list of rules looks like this: { \"rules\": { \"firebase_auth\": { \"$uid\": { \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } }, \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } } } } Conclusion \u00b6 All the blocks we've used in this guide Congratulations! You've successfully secured your Firebase database from malicious users! Here is a summary of what you've learned in this guide. How to set up a Google login system using Firebase Authentication.

The database currently has the following data: { \"*PROJECT_BUCKET*\" : { \"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwas@kodular.io\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Vishwas\\\"\" }, \"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"9.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"helios@helios.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Helios\\\"\" }, \"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\" : { \"android_version\" : \"\\\"8.1.0\\\"\", \"email\" : \"\\\"vishwasadiga@gmail.com\\\"\", \"name\" : \"\\\"Mr. Example\\\"\" }, \"uids\" : \"[\\\"AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1\\\", \\\"163IN5WF62eJsFeYQMmFdIIcAvl2\\\", \\\"KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62\\\"]\" } } A user currently authenticated with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 is able to fetch their own name, email, and Android version: The user is also able to edit the value of their name, email, and Android version. In addition, the user can access the names of other users, say, one with the uid KW4LkSOtG0Y1iede9KaTrwsYCx62 . But they cannot get the email or Android version of other users. Nor can they set the name, email, or Android version of other users.","title":"Rules for users' details"},{"location":"guides/component-examples/securing-app/#rules-for-list-of-uids","text":"Every user should be able to access the list of all uids, but should not be allowed to spam the list with random values. We can validate the data to ensure the user is appending their uid to the list, and not any other value. Validation can be done using the following rule: \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } With the rule set, all authenticated users will be able to read the value of the uids list. An authenticated user can also append their uid to the list. However, no other value except the user's uid can be entered. In essence, the newData variable must have a child that is the user's uid, which guarantees that the appended list has the correct uid. The current implementation, however, adds the user's unique id to the list every time they login. To keep only unique values of the uid, we prevent users from writing duplicates. The .write rule can be changed from \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists()\" to \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" This ensures that the uid is written only if the current data doesn't already contain it. Let's illustrate with the example of a user with the uid AL2uxus1arNfAWtviUIXboPdRqy1 . The user can append their uid to the list of all uids But cannot append anything other than their uid Our final list of rules looks like this: { \"rules\": { \"firebase_auth\": { \"$uid\": { \"name\": { \".read\": \"auth != null\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"email\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" }, \"android_version\": { \".read\": \"auth.uid == $uid\", \".write\": \"auth.uid == $uid\" } }, \"uids\" : { \".read\" : \"auth != null\", \".write\" : \"newData.child(auth.uid).exists() && !data.child(auth.uid).exists()\" } } } }","title":"Rules for list of uids"},{"location":"guides/component-examples/securing-app/#conclusion","text":"All the blocks we've used in this guide Congratulations!

You will create a sample application and randomly add 50% of all users to the \"Pro\" group, and then push notifications only to members of this group. Pre-requisites \u00b6 Here are some things you should know before you can get started with this guide. Setting up OneSignal in your app Info Take a look at our Community-made guide on setting up Push Notifications for your app here . First steps \u00b6 Head over to your OneSignal Dashboard to set up a new \"tag\". Tags can be used to identify specific users by their value. In this example, we will be creating a tag called \"pro\". Navigate to the \"Audience\" section using the tabs at the top of the page. Click on \"New Segment\" to create a group of users. The Segment's name will be the tag which we will pass from the app's blocks. Rename the Segment to \"Pro\" and click on \"Create Segment\". Your OneSignal app is now ready to handle users with the \"Pro\" tag! Designing the app \u00b6 As usual, we'll start with a new project. All we will need for this guide is the Push Notifications component in the Social category. Ensure you're using the correct OneSignal App ID for your app. This is what the designer should look like (not much to see...) Coding the blocks \u00b6 We will be using only nine blocks in this guide. When the screen is opened, we pick True or False at random and if True , we send the 'pro' tag to OneSignal. Info OneSignal tags are case insensitive , so pro and Pro are the same tag! Sending targeted notifications \u00b6 In the \"Messages\" section of your OneSignal Dashboard, click on \"New Push\" to create a new notification. Change the \"Audience\" setting to \"Send to Particular Segments\". Remove the default \"Subscribed Users\" segment and use the \"Add Segment\" button to add the \"Pro\" segment. Fill up the rest of the notification details as usual, and \"Confirm\" your push notification. That's it! Only \"Pro\" users will see the notification you just sent.

Below is a quick guide on setting up Funding Choices for your app. Set up Funding Choices account \u00b6 You will first need to register for a Google Funding Choices account if you do not have one already. To sign up, head over to https://fundingchoices.google.com/ and fill up the sign up form. Add consent gathering functionality to your app \u00b6 Go to the \"apps\" section from your Funding Choices dashboard. You should see all your registered apps listed. If you don't see your app, make sure you have registered it from your Google Ad Manager dashboard. Click on your app and press \"Create\" in the Messages section. Pick \"EU Consent\" as the message type. Give your message a name and select the default language you want it to be shown in to users. You may select additional languages that will be automatically chosen based on the locale of the user's device. Finally, select the type of consent you would like to show users. If you choose \"Consent/Manage options\", users will be able to opt-in to data collection by your app. If you choose \"Consent/Do not consent/Manage options\", users will be able to opt-out of data collection that is enabled by default. Customize your consent form \u00b6 You can customize the form that is shown to users so that it fits in with the branding of your app. You can change colors, fonts, and typography. Make sure to choose colors that have enough contrast and typography that clearly conveys your intent to acquire consent. Also ensure the text in the consent buttons are clear and concise. Vague or misleading text may void any consent you have gathered from users. Once you are done customizing the form, save it. Publishing your consent form \u00b6 When you are ready to request consent in your app, head over to the apps section of Funding Choices and select your app. Click on the more options button for the form you wish to activate and click on \"Publish\". Once successfully, your form's status should update to \"Active\". Your app will now start showing the consent form to relevant users. You do NOT need to update your app for these changes to take effect . Testing consent \u00b6 To test if your consent forms are working correctly, publish them from Funding Choices and enable \"Test Mode\" in your advertising components. Once you rebuild your app, you should see a consent form pop up every time you open it, regardless of whether you are in the EU/EEA/UK. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Some common reasons why consent forms may not be showing in your apps are: Your app ID in Funding Choices does not match what you have input in your app's \"Project Settings\" in the Creator. You have not published your form in Funding Choices. If test mode is disabled and you are not seeing a consent form, it may be because you are not in the EU/EEA/UK. If test mode is disabled and you are not seeing a consent form, it may be because you have already provided/declined consent previously.

Browser apps, apps that show content or media from other websites without the permission from the owner, or apps that use a trademarked name (for example \"Facebook\") are also not tolerated. Any attempts to disguise the content of your app such as changing the name, package name, app description, or category to mask its actual content can result in a permanent suspension of your Kodular account. After your app is approved, you understand that Kodular has the authority to reject or block the app at any time if it deems the app no longer adheres to the guidelines.","title":"Monetization guidelines"}]}
