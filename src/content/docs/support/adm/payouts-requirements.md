title: Why am I unable to withdraw my ad revenue?
---

Some common reasons why you may be unable to request a payout are

## Insufficient balance

You must have accrued **at least $15** before you can request a payout. If your balance is less than this minimum
amount, try again by the end of the month when accruals are handed out to all users and balances are updated.

## Invalid/incomplete account

Make sure you have provided a valid payment methodw
in [My Kodular > Payments > Payouts](https://my.kodular.io/payments/payouts). We cannot transfer money if we cannot
reach your payment address.

Also ensure you have submitted a tax form via the same page and have got it approved.

## Withdrawals paused temporarily

You will not be able to request a payout when a batch of other payouts from all users is currently being processed.
Please try again in a few minutes.
