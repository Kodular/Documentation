Cancelling a subscription is one of the easiest actions you can do. However, make sure you take
into account some important points before doing it, like what happens to your apps and when does
cancellation apply.  
It is important for you to know that **some cancellations can incur in extra charges**, if another
subscription depends on the cancelled plan by getting a discount.
