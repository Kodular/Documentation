title: Renewing a subscription
---

By completing a purchase, you agree to let Kodular charge your card automatically on a recurring basis.
This charge will incur in different moments of the billing period:

* For monthly subscriptions: when your first app purchased the product  
* For yearly subscriptions: when the app purchased the product (independently of the first app)

## Strong Customer Authentication

Kodular complies with latest European regulations for online payments. Thus, some European cardholders might
be required to complete an additional step called 3D-Secure. This is like a 2-Factor Authentication for purchases.  
For renewals, you will get an email if your bank requires you to finalize the payment.

## Invoices

After each successful payment, an invoice will be generated which can be downloaded in your [Billing panel](https://my.kodular.io/billing).
If you are a business and want to be VAT exempted, please [support@kodular.io](mailto:support@kodular.io).
